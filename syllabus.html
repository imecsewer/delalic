         <span><h3>Course Description</h3></span>
         <p>This curriculum is built on a foundation of problem solving and visual learning, aligned to the Common Core State Standards for advanced algebra. The topics above will be covered by interactive media, group problem solving, classroom discussion, and teacher and/or student presentations. Students will build on previous learning about linear and quadratic functions. Additionally, students learn to solve problems modeled by exponential and logarithmic functions, systems of equations and inequalities, and inverse variation. Students extend their understanding of the number systems to include complex numbers. Students will be introduced to periodic functions and basic trigonometric functions.</p>
